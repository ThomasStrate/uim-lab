Core computational components of the Unified Information Model (UIM)

# üåê UIM-Core

**UIM-Core** is the foundational Python library for simulating and exploring the Unified Information Model (UIM).

It provides a set of tools and models for working with **informational fields**, **resonance**, **resistance**, and **emergent perception** ‚Äî all without relying on traditional particle or wave mechanics.

---

## üß± Purpose

This library is the core engine behind all UIM experiments, including:

- Quantum phenomena as emergent field structures
- Resonance-based interpretation of energy and perception
- Informational resistance as the generator of mass, time, and structure
- Threshold-based reality rendering

## üîß Modules

The codebase is organized into the following core components:

| Module           | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| `field.py`       | Core informational grid, update mechanics |
| `resonance.py`   | Functions for harmonic propagation and feedback |
| `resistance.py`  | Local damping, informational inertia |
| `threshold.py`   | Perception gating and sigmoid functions |
| `visuals.py`     | Simple plotting and animation tools |
| `entropy.py`     | Measurement of order/disorder in field evolution |
